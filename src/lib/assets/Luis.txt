Heya! I'm Luis, a software engineer from Santander, with a masters in computing engineering, currently working <a href="https://pepperfinance.es" target="_blank" style="color: #000505">@Pepper</a> (Madrid).
I really enjoy web technologies (mainly backend related), AI, and anything coding really. So much so that I created this page! to be able to showcase my side projects. In the past I've worked with several languages, like Java, Python, C or JS/TS, using several different frameworks (like springboot, or svelteKit), but I'm always looking to expand my knowledge in computer science. If you feel curious and want to learn more, you can visit my github profile by clicking my picture.
Thank you for visiting and enjoy your stayðŸ˜Š
