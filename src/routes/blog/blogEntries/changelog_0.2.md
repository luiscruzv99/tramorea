After battling some problems with custom components, the blog infrastructure and styling is up and working (but still can change a lot). In summary, you can see the changes below:

#### Changes:

- The blog is up and running (you can check it out [here!](/blog)):
    -   The blog uses [MDSveX](https://mdsvex.com/) to convert the markdown entries into static html pages
    -   Blog entries use their own css themeing and components (so that link styling stays consistent)
    -   A page for all posts has been added: [all posts](/blog/posts)
    -   A **tag** system classifies posts, you can view the tags of an entry in the sidebar of the page, and all available tags [here](/blog/tags)
- The contact page has been removed *for now*
- New effects for links on hover have been added (this helps identigy navigable links)
- Pages have been given a custom title, to help with navigation
